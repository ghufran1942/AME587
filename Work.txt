1. Connect the Enable Pins to Dual PWM i.e. RC5 and RC4. ==> Code modification done: change: CCP1CON = 0b00001100; to CCP1CON = 0b10001100;
Note: 
    1. Don't reset the CCP1CON Register.
2. The C2OUT output control of PORTC must be disabled. ==> What does it mean?
3. Page No. 122. For more information on modulation.
4. The PWM Steering is available only when the CCP1M<3:2> = 11 and P1M<1:0> = 00 (CCP1CON register).
                                               CCP1CON    = 0b00001100
